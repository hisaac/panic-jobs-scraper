					<p class="intro">
						We love creating <span class="orange">amazing products</span> in a <span class="teal">fulfilling</span> and <span class="green">positive</span> way. Do you?
					</p>

					<p>Located in beautiful, rainy, extremely beautiful Portland, Oregon, we're an independent software company with about 30 employees and a lot going on. Founded in 1997 as a fully self-funded, independent, and sustainable business, our award-winning macOS and iOS apps, thoughtful games, and a brand new game platform are loved by users around the world.</p>

					<p>Our product philosophy: to create absolute best-of-class applications and tools that people need to use every day, and to experiment with new and uncertain ideas that can generate inspiration. Balancing both keeps our work interesting.</p>

					<p>We currently ship a very powerful <a href="https://nova.app/">web development IDE</a> for macOS; <a href="/prompt/">Prompt</a>, a wonderful SSH client for iOS, macOS, and visionOS; and <a href="/transmit/">Transmit</a>, the most powerful app for transferring files on macOS. We also publish video games — <a href="http://firewatchgame.com/">Firewatch</a> in 2016, <a href="https://goose.game/">Untitled Goose Game</a> in 2019, and <a href="https://thankgoodness.game">Thank Goodness You're Here!</a> in 2024, and many others. On top of all that, we make a handheld video game console called <a href="https://play.date">Playdate</a>.</p>

					<blockquote class="sticker">
						<p>
							<strong>Yes<i>!!</i></strong> We still believe in DEI.
						</p>
					</blockquote>

					<p>Today, our team (and often our industry) is missing the voices of a lot of people who could make our wonderful apps even better. <strong>We want that to change.</strong> We want to broaden our team to include folks whose diverse backgrounds and experiences will inspire and guide our products to new heights. <strong>We highly encourage women, people of color, and other resilient populations to apply for our open positions.</strong> We work hard to foster an environment at Panic that empowers individuality, empathy, and innovation, and we&rsquo;re looking forward to what you&rsquo;ll bring to the table.</p>

					<h2 class="title">Encouragement</h2>

					<p>If you read our job posting qualifications, and feel like you’re really, really close to hitting them all, but you’re missing one — or maybe you aren’t super confident or are prone to imposter syndrome and a voice is telling you to walk away — please consider pushing through and applying. None of us here are perfect geniuses or have it together 100% — we’re all just doing the best job we can, and we’re confident you can do that too. In fact studies show that women, people of color, and other resilient populations are less likely to apply if they don’t think they meet all requirements. Panic values these candidates and we want everyone who applies to be successful! Reach out if you have any questions!
